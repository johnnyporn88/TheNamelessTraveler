# TheNamelessTraveler
This is a Skyrim Wabbajack modlist.

If you're here because you installed the modlist, then read on for instructions on how to get some final configurations done.

# Vision

You are free to fork this repository to make modifications and improve upon it.
No credit needs to be given, no nothing. Skyrim modding is a platform upon which to make the game your own.

At this early stage of development, the intent of the list is for you to download the list and try it out.

# Problems?

Well, no support will be offered at this moment. As the development of the list is still in its early stages, it wouldn't make sense to try to fix things for now.

However, I will appreciate it if you could open a Github Issue documenting your issue. Perhaps the issue will be resolved naturally as development progresses. If not, I will make a patch for it after development of the list is done.
